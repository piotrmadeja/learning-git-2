         All these lines on my face getting clearer<br>
         The past is gone<br>
         It went by like dusk to dawn<br>
         Isn't that the way<br>
         Everybody's got their dues in life to pay.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Yeah, I know nobody knows<br>
         Where it comes and where it goes<br>
         I know it's everybody's sin<br>
         You got to lose to know how to win.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
         Half my life's in books' written pages<br>
         Live and learn from fools and from sages<br>
         You know it's true<br>
         All the things come back to you<br>
      </p>
      <p>Sing with me, sing for the year<br>
         Sing for the laughter and sing for the tears<br>
         Sing with me, if it's just for today<br>
         Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away /x2<br>
      <p>Dream on x3<br>
         Dream yourself a dream come true<br>
         Dream on x3<br>
         And dream until your dream come true<br>
         Dream on x7<br>
      </p>
      <p>Sing with me, sing for the year<br>
         Sing for the laughter and sing for the tears<br>
         Sing with me, if it's just for today<br>
         Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away /x2<br>
